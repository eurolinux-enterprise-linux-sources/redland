   from an existing one.
   API CHANGE [93]Iterator and [94]Stream classes. The next/get_next

   ownership of the passed in statement. The caller now retains ownership.
   API CHANGE [96]Model class. Method add_statements no longer frees the
   passed in librdf_stream; the caller must free it now.
   API CHANGE [97]Node and [98]Model classes. Added RDF Datatyped
   Literals. Other literal is_wf_xml constructors and methods deprecated.
   API CHANGE All literals methods and constructors have no mention of the
   never-used or supported XML Space argument which is not part of an RDF
   literal.

   changes as far as possible or warn about those that cannot be
   automatically updated.

   that supports contexts) can take an optional [101]Node, returned by the
   new get_context method on [102]Iterator and [103]Stream classes.
   Many portability and compiling fixes (OSX, gcc 3.x, FreeBSD, non-gcc
   compiler)

   finalize().
